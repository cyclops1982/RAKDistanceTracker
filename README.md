# RAK Distance Tracker

This is a simple test/example project on how to read the RAK12014 and RAK12007 with the RAK11300 via a platformio project.

The code outputs to the console.

## TODO

- Make the code use lora to send out a message
- REmove debug stuff
- Make things work with edge cases (for exmaple, when the measurement is too far away or unclear)
